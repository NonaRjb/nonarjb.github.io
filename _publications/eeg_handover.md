title: "Detecting the Intention of Object Handover in Human-Robot Collaborations: An EEG Study"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/eeg_handover
excerpt: 'This paper shows that temporal patterns in EEG signals can be used to predict whether a person will execute a motor task in a human-to-robot handover scenario with an average accuracy of 94.7%. It further demonstrates that time-frequency features of EEG in the final second before movement can distinguish handover actions from other actions, and classifies human intentions for different tasks using pre-movement EEG with an average pairwise accuracy of 63.5%. Together, these results contribute evidence that EEG-based intention recognition is a feasible approach for detecting human handover intentions in HRC.'

This paper shows that temporal patterns in EEG signals can be used to predict whether a person will execute a motor task in a human-to-robot handover scenario with an average accuracy of 94.7%. It further demonstrates that time-frequency features of EEG in the final second before movement can distinguish handover actions from other actions, and classifies human intentions for different tasks using pre-movement EEG with an average pairwise accuracy of 63.5%. Together, these results contribute evidence that EEG-based intention recognition is a feasible approach for detecting human handover intentions in HRC.
