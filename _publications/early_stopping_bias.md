title: "Deep Learning Amplified Early Stopping Bias: Overestimating Performance on Small Datasets"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/early_stopping_bias
excerpt: 'This paper shows that using cross-validation both for hyperparameter/early-stopping selection and performance estimation, bespecially in deep networks and small datasets, can severely and systematically overestimate model performance, even yielding very high ROC-AUC on random data.'
