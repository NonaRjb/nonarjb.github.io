title: "Early detection of human handover intentions in human-robot collaboration: Comparing EEG, gaze, and hand motion"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/compare_modality_handover
excerpt: 'This paper develops and compares multimodal intention detectors based on EEG, gaze, and hand-motion signals to distinguish handover from non-handover actions in human–robot collaboration, demonstrating that all three modalities can reveal handover intention but that gaze provides the earliest and most accurate classification.'
