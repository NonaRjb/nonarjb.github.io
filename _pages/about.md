I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) under the supervision of Professor [Danica Kragic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZlSVieAAAAAJ&hl=en). 
My research focuses on developing machine learning methods for human bio-signals, particularly electroencephalogram (EEG) data, an inherently noisy and highly multivariate signal with a low signal-to-noise ratio. I aim to decode perception and intention from EEG by leveraging multimodal learning approaches that integrate complementary signals such as visual input, gaze direction, and respiratory patterns to enhance representation quality and task performance.
