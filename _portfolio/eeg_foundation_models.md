title: "EEG Foundation Models"
excerpt: "<div style='text-align:center;'><img src='/images/foundation.png' style='max-width:600px; height:auto;'></div>In my recent work, I have become increasingly interested in large-scale “foundation models” that learn general-purpose representations from EEG. By training on massive datasets spanning diverse tasks, recording sessions, and participants, these models offer a way to overcome one of the central challenges in EEG research: poor generalization beyond the specific conditions they were trained on. My goal is to develop EEG foundation models that can serve as robust building blocks for both clinical and research applications, making it easier to adapt EEG-based methods to new tasks and real-world settings with minimal additional data."
