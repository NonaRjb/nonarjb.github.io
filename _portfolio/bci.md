Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) create a direct communication channel between the brain and computers. In my work, I focus on EEG-based BCIs, which are especially attractive because EEG is relatively easy and affordable to record in real-world settings. I am particularly interested in designing and evaluating novel BCI paradigms where EEG signals reveal a person’s intentions or perceptions, allowing computers and robots to respond to more implicit commands of the users.
