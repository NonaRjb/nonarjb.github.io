title: "Visual Decoding from the Brain"
excerpt: "<div style='text-align:center;'><img src='/images/visual_decoding.png' style='max-width:600px; height:auto;'></div>Visual decoding aims to recover or reconstruct what a person sees or imagines from their brain activity. In my research, I focus on decoding visual stimuli from EEG signals, a particularly challenging setting due to EEG’s low signal-to-noise ratio. I explore how more powerful image encoders and generative models can turn these noisy brain signals into more faithful visual reconstructions. I am also interested in closing the loop with human feedback, using people’s judgments about the generated images to iteratively refine and improve the mapping from EEG activity to visual space."
